    'product_customs' => '<h1 class="p-4">Customs (documentary) clearance and release of goods:</h1><p class="p-4 fs-4">This function includes receiving documents from the customs warehouse on your behalf, organizing the completion of the transit declaration, submitting the customs declaration to the customs authorities, and releasing the goods.</p>',
    'obtaining_permits' => '<h1>Obtaining permits:</h1><p class="p-4 fs-4">For a number of goods, it is necessary to obtain permits from the relevant government departments of the Republic of Armenia during import, export, or transit transportation, such as licenses, conclusions, clarifications, and others.</p>',
    'preliminary_customs_declaration' => '<h1>Preliminary customs declaration:</h1><p class="p-4 fs-4">If no laboratory examination of the goods is required, a preliminary customs declaration can be made, allowing the goods to be delivered directly to the recipient’s warehouse, bypassing the customs warehouse. This helps the importer save on storage costs and avoid penalties for potential delays.</p>',
    'obtaining_conformity_certificates' => '<h1>Issuance of EAC conformity certificates:</h1><p class="p-4 fs-4">For the export of a wide range of goods to EAEU member states, as well as for the import of certain goods, an EAC conformity certificate is required. We can arrange for the issuance of this certificate in a very short period of time.</p>',
    'product_classification' => '<h1>Obtaining classification decisions from customs authorities:</h1><p class="p-4 fs-4">When importing greenhouses, mobile homes, and other goods, if the goods arrive disassembled in several batches, it is possible to obtain a single HS code from the EAEU for the final finished product. This allows the business entity to save on VAT and part of the customs duty.</p>',
    'recycling' => '<h1>Obtaining processing permits from customs authorities:</h1><p class="p-4 fs-4">In this case, it is possible to avoid paying customs duties and VAT on imported goods. This service is especially useful for manufacturing companies that import raw materials, process them, and either re-export the goods or sell the finished products on the Armenian market. It also applies to those who supply raw materials to third countries (non-EAEU members), receive finished goods, and re-import them to Armenia.</p>',
    'cordial' => '<h1>Delivery of goods to the recipient’s warehouse:</h1><p class="p-4 fs-4">After customs clearance and release, so that the business entity does not waste time and resources on renting a vehicle to deliver goods to its warehouse, we organize the delivery of goods to the recipient’s warehouse (the cost of transportation is paid by the business entity).</p>',
    'preparation_documents_necessary_carrying_foreign_economic_activities' => '<h2>Preparation of documents for foreign economic activity:</h2><p class="p-4 fs-4">When conducting foreign economic activity, there is always a need to prepare certain documents (invoice, CMR, delivery agreement, etc.).
